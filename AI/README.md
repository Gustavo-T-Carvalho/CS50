# Invincible AI - Tic Tac Toe
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wkjW-u_Cbg
#### Description:

Inspired by the CS50x 2024 - Artificial Intelligence video where David explain the possibility of a AI that never loses in a Tic Tac Toe I proposed to implement that AI. I used an decision tree that is loaded when the programm is executed. The decision is made based in pontuations for the board scenaries and some scenaries (Can win, Prevent lose). I also did some ASCII art. If the programm is executed with a parameter 2 it enters in multiplayer mode and the AI is not used.
